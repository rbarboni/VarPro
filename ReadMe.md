This repo provides the code to reproduce the numerical result presented in the paper:
["Ultra-fast feature learning for the training of two-layer neural networks in the two-timescale regime"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18208)

The code for:

* experiments with ReLU-SHL and 1d features (Section 6.1) is located in the directory `VarPro_ReLU_1d`,

* experiments with ResNets on CIFAR10 (Section 6.2) is located in the directory `VarPro_resnet`,

* experiments with RBF-NN and 2d features (Appendix B) is located in the directory `VarPro_convolution_2d`.
